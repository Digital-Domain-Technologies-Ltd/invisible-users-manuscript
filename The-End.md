# The End

This book examines how modern web design optimised for human users fails for AI agents, and how fixing this benefits everyone. The field of AI agent compatibility is moving rapidly, with new developments emerging regularly.

## Additional Resources Available Online

As this is a fast-moving field, comprehensive appendices and additional materials are maintained online to ensure they remain current and relevant. These resources include practical implementation guides, quick references, and real-world case studies.
