4. Legal and regulatory changes affecting agent access
5. Major website implementations of agent-friendly patterns

## Changelog: Post-Publication Additions

### 13 January 2026 - Adobe AI Traffic Report

**Added to Appendix J:** "Adobe AI Traffic Report - Massive Growth Across Industries (January 2026)"

Adobe Analytics reported extraordinary growth in AI-driven traffic based on analysis of over 1 trillion visits to U.S. websites during the 2025 holiday season:

**Key findings:**

- Retail AI traffic grew 693% year-over-year
- AI conversions now 31% HIGHER than non-AI (was 51% LOWER 12 months ago)
- AI revenue per visit 32% higher - complete reversal from 2024
- Cross-industry growth: Travel +539%, Financial Services +266%, Tech/Software +120%
- 81% of consumers report improved shopping experience with AI assistance
- 38% have used AI for shopping, 52% plan to use it this year

**Validates chapters:** Preface (market acceleration), Chapter 1 (agent traffic growth), Chapter 8 (improved user experience), Chapter 9 (platform race urgency)

**Challenges assumptions:** Chapter 4's revenue decline concerns - AI traffic now generates MORE revenue for e-commerce sites, not less. Complete performance reversal in just 12 months.

**Geographic scope:** Data is U.S.-only. Many AI platforms and campaigns are trialling in the United States first, with global expansion expected as platforms mature. Pattern demonstrates trajectory for global markets.
