**The market is in rocket-fuel mode.** Platform launches, protocol announcements, and major implementations happen weekly. This changelog tracks what gets added to the live appendix and when:

- **This file:** Internal changelog showing what was added when

## Six Categories Tracked in Appendix J

Only news meeting ALL five relevance criteria (chapter validation, production reality, commercial pressure, timeline impact, ecosystem shift) gets added:

1. AI agent platform launches and capabilities
2. Commerce protocol developments (ACP, UCP, proprietary systems)
3. Identity delegation and authentication standards
4. Legal and regulatory changes affecting agent access
5. Major website implementations of agent-friendly patterns
6. Standards evolution (llms.txt adoption, proposed patterns becoming standards)

## Changelog: Post-Publication Additions

### 13 January 2026 - Perplexity Comet Browser

**Added to Appendix J:** Perplexity Comet Browser - Free AI-Powered Browser with Agent-Mode Automation (October 2025)

**Validates chapters:** 2, 6 (browser agent interaction patterns, session inheritance architecture)

Perplexity AI released Comet browser to the public for free in October 2025, bringing browser-based AI agent automation to millions of daily users. Initial launch in July 2025 was limited to $200/month Max subscribers; free global release in October democratized access to Agent-Mode automation, multi-step workflows, and voice-activated browser control.

**Key significance:** Comet demonstrates the session inheritance architecture discussed in Chapter 6:101 (which mentions "Claude for Chrome (launched December 2025)" as an example). Comet launched earlier (July 2025, free October 2025) and represents the same pattern - browser agents inheriting authenticated sessions, making detection impossible. Search engine company now owns browser, validating Chapter 9's platform race predictions.

### 13 January 2026 - Adobe AI Traffic Report

**Added to Appendix J:** "Adobe AI Traffic Report - Massive Growth Across Industries (January 2026)"

Adobe Analytics reported extraordinary growth in AI-driven traffic based on analysis of over 1 trillion visits to U.S. websites during the 2025 holiday season:

**Key findings:**

- Retail AI traffic grew 693% year-over-year
- AI conversions now 31% HIGHER than non-AI (was 51% LOWER 12 months ago)
- AI revenue per visit 32% higher - complete reversal from 2024
- Cross-industry growth: Travel +539%, Financial Services +266%, Tech/Software +120%
- 81% of consumers report improved shopping experience with AI assistance
- 38% have used AI for shopping, 52% plan to use it this year

**Validates chapters:** Preface (market acceleration), Chapter 1 (agent traffic growth), Chapter 8 (improved user experience), Chapter 9 (platform race urgency)

**Challenges assumptions:** Chapter 4's revenue decline concerns - AI traffic now generates MORE revenue for e-commerce sites, not less. Complete performance reversal in just 12 months.

**Geographic scope:** Data is U.S.-only. Many AI platforms and campaigns are trialling in the United States first, with global expansion expected as platforms mature. Pattern demonstrates trajectory for global markets.

**See:** Full 12-section entry in Appendix J with comprehensive analysis, business model implications, and strategic recommendations.
