# Reading Guide

The Invisible Users is designed to be read sequentially, with each chapter building on concepts introduced earlier. However, you don't need to read everything with equal depth. This guide provides tailored reading paths for different audiences, allowing you to focus on the sections most relevant to your role.

## Reading Path for Developers

You need implementation patterns and technical depth.

**Start with:**

- Chapter 10: Technical Advice (immediate patterns and code examples for websites)
- Chapter 11: What Agent Creators Must Build (validation layers and guardrails for agents)

**Then work backwards:**

- Chapter 9: Designing for Both (strategic patterns)
- Chapter 6: The Security Maze (authentication and access control)
- Chapter 2: The Invisible Failure (what's breaking and why)
- Chapter 3: The Architectural Conflict (design perspective)

**For business case:**

- Chapter 4: The Business Reality (commercial arguments)
- Chapter 5: The Content Creator's Dilemma (revenue model challenges)
- Chapter 8: The Human Cost (human impact)

Use the implementation checklist and code examples. There's a glossary at the end - some terms have specific meanings here.

**Reading approach:** Technical focus

## Reading Path for Agent System Developers

You're building AI agents, browser extensions, or agentic systems that interact with websites. You need validation frameworks and guardrails.

**Start with:**

- Chapter 11: What Agent Creators Must Build (validation layers, confidence scoring, pipeline failure prevention)

**Essential context:**

- Chapter 2: The Invisible Failure (what breaks for agents and why)
- Chapter 3: The Architectural Conflict (website design patterns your agents will encounter)

**Implementation patterns:**

- Chapter 10: Technical Advice (website-side patterns your agents should expect)

**Business context:**

- Chapter 4: The Business Reality (commercial pressures affecting website design)
- Chapter 6: The Security Maze (authentication challenges for agents)

Focus on the £203,000 cruise pricing case study (Appendix I) - it demonstrates exactly why validation layers, comparative analysis, and confidence scoring are essential. Your agents will encounter malformed data, ambiguous HTML, and incomplete information. Chapter 11 provides the frameworks to handle these gracefully.

**Reading approach:** Targeted reading

## Reading Path for Small Business Owners

You need to determine if this matters for your business and what to do about it.

**Read in full:**

- Chapter 1: What You Will Learn (understand the problem)
- Chapter 4: The Business Reality (use the decision tree)

**Focus on:**

- Small business sections in Chapter 9 (practical actions)

**Optional:**

- Chapter 2 (if you want technical understanding)
- Chapter 8 (if you care about broader access implications)

Many relationship-based local businesses can safely deprioritise this. The decision tree in Chapter 4 and the Executive Summary will help you determine your priority level.

**Reading approach:** Quick overview

## Other Navigation Aids

**Glossary**: Technical terms are defined at the end of the book. Some terms have specific meanings in this context that differ from casual usage.

**Sequential Reading**: If you have time, read the chapters in order. Each builds on concepts introduced earlier.
