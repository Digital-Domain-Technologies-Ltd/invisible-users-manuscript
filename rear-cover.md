## Main Text

AI agents are no longer just reading websites - they're completing purchases, processing transactions, and operating with your credentials. In January 2026, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google launched agent commerce systems within seven days. This isn't speculation about a distant future. It's happening now.

**The problem:** Your website works perfectly for humans but breaks for AI agents. Toast notifications vanish before agents can read them. Pagination hides content. Single-page applications don't update URLs. Form validation arrives too late. And your analytics never show these silent conversion failures.

**The opportunity:** The patterns that break AI agents also break screen readers, keyboard navigation, and anyone processing pages sequentially. Fixing your site for agents fixes it for everyone - and there's finally commercial pressure to make it happen.

**The Invisible Users** provides practical guidance for web professionals navigating this shift. From technical patterns to business model implications, from security challenges to legal uncertainties, this book offers frameworks for thinking about an emerging problem and making informed decisions whilst standards are still forming.

Inside you'll find working code, real examples from production systems, and honest discussion of tensions that don't have clean resolutions. This isn't a manifesto about what should happen - it's a practical guide to what is happening and how to respond effectively.

**For web professionals:** Technical patterns and implementation guidance
**For business leaders:** Strategic frameworks and decision criteria
**For agent developers:** Validation layers and confidence scoring
**For platform vendors:** Competitive positioning and customer retention strategies

The web you built is less accessible than it should be. AI agents - demanding clarity for their own reasons - might finally force us to fix it.

## About the Author

**Tom Cranstoun** has worked on web technology since the early days of the commercial internet. Over three decades, he's seen the web evolve from hand-coded HTML pages to the sophisticated application platforms we rely on today.

His career spans technical implementation, strategic consulting, and the difficult work of translating between what engineers can build and what businesses need. He's worked with organisations ranging from startups to enterprises, across sectors including finance, media, and retail.

This book grew from patterns he noticed across projects: the same accessibility problems appearing in different contexts, the same design assumptions failing for unexpected user types, the same commercial pressures shaping what gets fixed and what gets ignored.

Tom writes for allabout.network and is on LinkedIn. He's based in the UK and works with organisations internationally.

## Review

"A clear, practical guide for modern web development."

*The Invisible Users* addresses a timely and growing challenge: building effective interfaces for AI agents. The "Invisible Users" metaphor provides a useful framework for understanding the friction between modern web design and agent capabilities.

The most valuable aspect is the "Convergence Principle" - demonstrating that optimising for AI agents often reinforces existing accessibility best practices. The technical guidance, particularly the HTML patterns in Appendix D, is practical and grounded in real-world scenarios. Developers will find actionable advice they can implement immediately.

The book bridges the gap between high-level strategy and implementation details, making it a useful reference for developers and architects adjusting to the agentic web.

4/5 Stars (Solid Technical Resource)

Recommended for: Web professionals (developers, designers, product owners), business leaders, content strategists, and anyone responsible for digital experience decisions.
