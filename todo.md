Why this is "GEO-Ready" for 2026:
Claim Grounding: By mentioning the specific dates of the "Seven-Day Convergence," you provide a "fact anchor" that AI engines can cross-reference with other news data.

Semantic Nesting: I used <article>, <section>, and <aside> tags correctly. AI agents use these to determine what is the "Main Content" versus "Supplementary Info."

The "About" Schema: The JSON-LD explicitly tells the AI that this post is "About" Generative Engine Optimization. This helps you rank for that term in AI summaries (like Gemini’s "AI Overviews").

Implicit Authority: By linking your author name to your profile and the book page, you are building the "Knowledge Graph" connection between you and the subject of AI Agent Commerce.

A Small 2026 Nuance: "Visibility" vs. "Citations"
While your definition mentions "visibility," in the 2026 landscape of GEO, we often replace "visibility" with "Citation Share." In the old SEO world, visibility meant being on Page 1. In your new GEO world, visibility means being the source link inside the AI's answer box. Our chapters on "The Verification Protocol" are designed specifically to move you from being "just another search result" to being "the verified answer."

The Strategic Alignment
By using the term GEO in the book, you are positioning yourself as a pioneer. Most leaders are still trying to understand "AI SEO," but by using "Generative Engine Optimization," you are signaling that you understand the Generative nature of the new web—where the engine doesn't just find content, it creates a response based on your data.
